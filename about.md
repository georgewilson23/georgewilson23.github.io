## About this site

I first developed this site in May 2020 as a project to refresh my front-end development skills and begin cultivating my personal brand.

All of the photos and content found on these pages are my own, unless otherwise noted. 

This webapp uses [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/) , a free blogging theme for Jekyll.
