The recent protests across the United States in response George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police office **highlight the systematic oppression of black people and minorities** which has lasted for centuries. The microscope is currently on policing and the criminal justice system -- and rightly so. It is also important to recognize that institutional racism persists in education, housing, financial institutions, health care, and technology. Artificial intelligence, a tool enthusiastically applied within all of these systems, is prone to mirroring societal biases and amplifying them. I discuss them in my undergraduate thesis embedded in this post. I concluded that democratic research policies and public negotiation are necessary avoid autocratic algorithms.

I cannot understand the difficulties and disadvantages of the other groups because _I have benefited from them_. I must take it upon myself to stay informed. I must act as an ally and advocate no matter the circumstances.
