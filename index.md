  Welcome to my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages.

Currently, I am a Data & Analytics consultant at [CapTech](https://www.captechconsulting.com/) based in Denver, Colorado.
I studied Systems Engineering and Statistics at University of Virginia and I have previously held positions at [Locus Health](https://www.locushealth.com/) and [Forge](https://joinforge.co/).

_I love to learn_. This site itself is an attempt to familiarize myself with web development despite usually working with back-end databases. Living in Colorado, I have turned to exploring this beautiful state with new hobbies. This year, I started bouldering, mountain biking, and trail running in addition to my long-standing hobbies of hiking and skiing. 

You'll find more than a resume here -- I intend to regularly upload [articles](/posts) and [data visualizations and photos](/portfolio).
