  Welcome to my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages.

Currently, I am a Data & Analytics consultant at [CapTech](https://www.captechconsulting.com/) based in Denver, Colorado.


You'll find more than a resume here -- I intend to regularly upload [articles](/posts), data [visualizations and photos](/portfolio).

_I am an avid learner_. This site itself is an attempt to familiarize myself with web development despite usually working with back-end databases. Living in Colorado, I have turned to exploring this beautiful state with new hobbies. This year, I started bouldering, mountain biking, and trail running in addition to my long-standing hobbies of hiking and skiing.
